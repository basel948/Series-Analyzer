In this project we worked in a team of 3.
we shared the task equally amongs us.

Basel => the functions of Count , Sort , Replace 
Tasneem => the functions of Check_args , Avg , Sum 
Safa => the functions of Min , Max , Print 

in this project we display a bunch of options from a menu that can work with a set of numbers.
from there after every option we give the user to enter another option from the menu until he exits the menu by him self.
