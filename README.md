In this project we worked in a team of 3.
We shared the task equally amongs us.

Basel => the functions of Count,Avg, and Sum.  
Tasneem => the functions of Check_args, Sort, and Replace 
Safa => the functions of Min, Max, and Print 

In this project we display a bunch of options from a menu that can work with a set of numbers.
from there after every option we give the user to enter another option from the menu until he exits the menu by himself.
